# Git Workflow Practice

## Overview

I will be using this repo to note down the things I have learned from working with git. For example, using git rebase, git merge, and so on. I will attempt to provide visuals to show my understanding of these topics. Also, i hope to provide edge cases when attempting these workflows.
